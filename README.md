# RT2_jupyter-notebook

This notebook pertains to the second assignment completed in the Research Track 1 course. The objective was to develop a notebook that would serve as a replacement for the user interface on node_a.

In this notebook, widgets will be utilized primarily to achieve the following objectives:

- Managing the robot's movement within the environment.
- Displaying the positions of the robot and the target in the form of a plot, using FuncAnimation.
- Tracking the targets that are set or cancelled within the environment, including their distance, goal, and quantity.
- Providing information about the distance to the nearest obstacle, which can be shown either in a text box or plotted if the laser scanner is used.
